# Application Code Manager for Fluent Forms

A custom WordPress plugin developed to manage and validate one-time application codes before users can access or submit a Fluent Form. It ensures that only applicants with valid, unused codes can proceed with form submission. Once a form is submitted, the code is marked as used and cannot be reused.

> 🏫 Originally developed for **Wesley University, Lagos Centre** as part of their online application system.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Admin interface to add, view, and delete codes
- ✅ AJAX-based code verification before form access
- ✅ Prevents duplicate or reused code submissions
- ✅ Auto-mark codes as used only after successful form submission
- ✅ Logs the full name of the user who used the code
- ✅ Clean separation of logic with no effect on existing site behaviour

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Admin uploads codes** via the dashboard (one per line).
2. **User enters full name + code** → clicks "Verify Code".
3. **If valid**, the form fields appear and the code is saved in a hidden field.
4. On **successful submission**, the plugin marks the code as "used" and stores the submitter's name.
5. The code becomes unavailable to future users.

## 📥 Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the WordPress dashboard.
2. Activate it from the **Plugins** page.
3. Go to **Application Codes** in the admin menu to manage codes.

## 🧪 Fluent Forms Setup

In your Fluent Form:

- Add:
  - A text field named `application_code`
  - A text field named `your_name` (or whatever the name field is)
  - A hidden field named `application_code_confirmed`

- Add a **custom section** above the form with:
  - A wrapper div: `#verify-code-wrapper`
  - A verify button: `#verify-code-btn`

The plugin JS handles the AJAX verification and form reveal.
